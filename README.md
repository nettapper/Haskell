# Haskell

My main goal is to learn [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), this repo exists to track the progress of that journey.

## Current Progress in Haskell Book

> The times below track my progresss through the Haskell Book (see link below).  
> [Haskell Programming From First Principals](http://haskellbook.com/) written by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki  
> I'd **highly** reccomend the book if you're interested in Haskell, it is a great book for independent learners!  

Haskell_Ch01_to_Ch07_Time â‰ˆ 10hrs  
Haskell_Ch08_Time = sum [2, 37, 62] = 101 = 1 hr 41 min  
Haskell_Ch09_Time = sum [45, 37, 23, 20, 32, 49, 86, 5] = 297 = 4 hr 57 min  
Haskell_Ch10_Time = sum [9, 18, 53, 51, 11, 32, 15, 24] = 213 = 3 hr 33 min  
Haskell_Ch11_Time = sum [22, 20, 74, 17, 46, 23, 54, 2, 104, 29, 19, 55, 37, 44, 66] = 612 = 10 hr 12 min  
Haskell_Ch12_Time = sum [9, 49, 22, 43, 13, 30, 47, 36] = 249 = 4 hr 09 min  
Haskell_Ch13_Time = sum [16, 53, 56, 6, 20, 22, 51] = 224 = 3 hr 44 min  
Haskell_Ch14_Time = sum [25, 48, 133, 34, 58, 56, 30, 6, 28, 14, 21] = 453 = 7 hr 33 min  
Haskell_Ch15_Time = sum [23, 39, 15, 31, 12]  

**Note:** I've recorded this data always rounding to the nearest minute. The only exception is that Ch1 to Ch7 are extimates because I didn't decide that I wanted to record the time it took to complete each chapter until I was part way through Ch07. I estimated Ch1 to Ch7 based on the time the other chapters took, the number of haskell videos I've watched on YouTube (>20hrs), and my time programming with Haskell before. I'd consider 10hrs a very conservative estimate for the first 7 chapters. YMMV.

**Note2:** Unfortunately I forgot to time myself the last time I was programming in Haskell. I know that I spent between 0 and 50 minutes because I was programming during a break between classes. I'm fairly confident that it between 32 and 42 minutes but now there is no way to know for sure. I've decided to mark this as 37 minutes in Ch11.
