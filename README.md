# Haskell

My main goal is to learn [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), this repo exists to track the progress of that journey.

## Current Progress

Haskell_Ch08_Time = sum [2, 37, 62] = 101 = 1 hr 41 min
Haskell_Ch09_Time = sum [45, 37, 23, 20, 32, 49, 86, 5] = 297 = 4 hr 57 min
Haskell_Ch10_Time = sum [9, 18, 53, 51, 11, 32, 15, 24] = 213 = 3 hr 33 min
Haskell_Ch11_Time = sum [22, 20, 74, 17, 46, 23, 54, 2, 104, 29, 19, 55]
